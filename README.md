# Life Expectancy Prediction with Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  

This project explores data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on multiple health and demographic parameters.  
The workflow includes careful feature inspection, missing value handling, and model experimentation with different algorithms.
