# Life Expectancy Prediction with Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  

This project explores data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to predict life expectancy based on multiple health and demographic parameters.  
The workflow includes careful feature inspection, missing value handling, and model experimentation with different algorithms.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**  
  - Handle missing values with imputation strategies  
  - Remove unnecessary or low-impact features  
- **Feature Engineering**  
  - Feature-label correlation analysis  
  - Normalization and encoding of categorical variables  
- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest Regressor  
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor  
  - Model evaluation with metrics (RÂ², MAE, RMSE)  
## Conclusion
the dataset is too small after cleaning to have good accuracy of predictions.
